# CacheAwarenessProject
This project is effectively a study of how writing the same algorithm in different ways can make a huge difference in performance.

The code was run on Manjaro Linux, compiled with gcc with the -O2 flag supplied.

Each configuration was run 7 times, with the last 5 runs recorded to try and 
alleviate the OS scheduling issues. Sufficient time was provided to let the 
laptop cool down to not have thermal throttling affect our results. 

The CPU running the program was an i7-7700HQ.

This code was made for the production of a youtube video, you can see the results
of the experiment and explanation for why the results are what they are here.
